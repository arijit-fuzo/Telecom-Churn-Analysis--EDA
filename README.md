### Payment Methods

### Tenure  
- Customers of **<1 year** tenure are at **50% churn risk**.
- Churn lowers to **35%** between 1–3 years and **15%** >3 years.
> Early engagement from customers can directly influence their decision to stick.

### Internet Service Type  
- **Fiber Optic consumers** are at higher risk to churn (30%) as against **DSL users** (20%).

### Senior Citizens
